Models.zip was obsolete, it was removed from the archives. Try instead the cases with BELLHOP, KRAKEN and SCOOTER. Want to contribute? Send me your sound speed profiles. 

If Python complains that "TabError: inconsistent use of tabs and spaces in indentation" then go to the line where the error happens and replace all tabs with spaces. If you find a way to automatize the process let me know!
