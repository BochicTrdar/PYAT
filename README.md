Don't like it? Don't use it.

Models.zip was obsolete, it was removed from the archives. Try instead the cases with BELLHOP, KRAKEN and SCOOTER. Want to contribute? Send me your sound speed profiles. 

If Python complains that "TabError: inconsistent use of tabs and spaces in indentation" then go to the line where the error happens and replace all tabs with spaces. If you find a way to automatize the process let me know!

Try some of the examples:
- python3 bellhop3d_wedge_rays.py
- python3 bellhop3d_wedge_tl.py
- python3 bellhop_block_rays.py
- python3 kraken3d_wedge_tl.py
- python3 kraken_bartlett.py
- python3 kraken_elba_tl.py

Windows users: If your OS is windows you can try one of the following: 
(1) Download the *.zip file with the windows binaries from the Acoustic Toolbox site, unpack it and set the path for the system to find the binaries. If the binaries work then you are very lucky and running the models is up to you. 
(2) If the binaries do not work then install Cygwin (https://cygwin.com/) and compile the models. Good luck with that. 
(3) If you don't have the patience and/or time to install the models with Cygwin get the WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux) and install the models as any Linux user does. Good luck with that too.
